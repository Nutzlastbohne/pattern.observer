=== Obersever Pattern ===

-- Naming Conventions --

Subject	- Notifies list of registered objects to update their status
Object	- Receiver of Subject updates

-- Other Names --

Viewer	- Implementations of 'Objects' 

-- How it works --
After initializing the Subject, instances of observers are created, which register themselves to the subject.
Changing values in the Subject will call a special method, which loops over a list of observers and calls their "update" method
